Meal Tracker Web Application:
By Ililochi Onwuzu


Description:
This web application was designed to allow a user to track their daily calorie intake by entering a meal, a description about the meal and its number of calories. A timestamp is attached to the entry. The user is able to filter the list of meals by the number of calories and the date of entry. The filters are stable and were designed using Angular Pipes. The total calories of the meals listed are displayed in the top left of the web page. Total Calories responds to calorie edit.


Improvements Needed:
 * This application is not "yet" database backed so cannot store data
 * Total Calories should respond to filtering so only the total calories of the meals displayed are calculated


Setup/Installation Requirements:
 * First clone this repository with npm and bower installed
 * Run "npm install" at the root of the directory
 * Run "bower install"
 * Run "gulp serve"
